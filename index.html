                      <h1><u>THE BEST WAY TO EVALUATE MOVING COMPANIES</u></h1>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>When you start the relocation process, you look for a reputable moving company. Unless you want to do that by yourself. Nowadays, you can find a lot of businesses that offer relocation services all over the world — from <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/new-jersey-movers/new-brunswick/"> New Brunswick movers</a> to the Kuwait-based ones. But how can you <b>evaluate moving companies</b> especially if you’re doing it for the first time? How do you know which one is the best and safest?</p>
                <p>Because of that, we have made a comprehensive list of questions you ought to ask when choosing the mover that fits your needs. So we recommend you create a checklist and write down the answers for each question. That’s how you compare moving companies based on the same criteria. </p>
                <p>Evaluate moving companies based on prices</p>
                <p>The price of relocation usually plays the most significant role when evaluating movers. For instance, if you are a Brooklyn resident preparing for a move to Chicago, you have to choose one of many <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/services/long-distance-movers/"> long distance movers NYC</a> has in its range. Don’t go for the cheapest offers. Not all inexpensive deals are the best ones. Most scams happen when customers get attracted by incredibly cheap estimates. That is the main tactic of <b>rogue movers</b>.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, some prices can be overrated. And your task is to find a satisfying option that won’t be too cheap or too expensive. </p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/moving-price-300x172.jpg"></div>
                <h4>The cost of relocation is really important. But it shouldn’t be the main and decisive factor.</h4>
                <section>
                    <a class="button-link"
                        href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mNxenBeB7Mzz921QA">Find Us Here!</a>
                </section>
                <p>In order to find out such data, you should get an estimate from a moving company. Reputable movers come to your place and calculate the approximate costs based on the volume of your stuff and moving distance. </p>
                <p>Evaluating movers based on their affiliations</p>
                <p>There are three things you must pay attention to considering this criterion. It is necessary to look at each of them in order to compare movers and pick the right one.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/feedback-3584509_1920-300x236.jpg"></div>
                <h4>Create your own checklist and scale in order to compare movers and make the right decision.</h4>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>1. Registration and license</p>
                <p>To begin with, a moving company has to be <b>registered and licensed</b>. Interstate movers must have a U.S. DOT number registered with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. You can use this <a href="https://ai.fmcsa.dot.gov/hhg/search.asp/"> FMCSA tool</a> in order to check that information. Also, local state laws and regulations may apply.</p>
                <p>2. Insurance</p>
                <p>A renowned moving company must also have insurance, which is another plus when evaluating movers. If something goes wrong during the transport of your belongings, and the company does not obtain insurance, you risk losing them. Otherwise, <b>an insured mover will guarantee the safety of your stuff</b>.</p>
                <p>3. Track record</p>
                <p>Check the company’s <b>credibility, history, and ratings</b>. You can do that online on <a href="https://www.bbb.org/"> the Better Business Bureau</a> website. It is an organization that creates reviews of services and accredits businesses, which extremely helps when you are evaluating moving companies. If the mover isn’t on their list or has a low ranking, move on to another one.</p>
                <p>Evaluate moving companies based on recommendations</p>
                <p>Feel free to get some advice and <i>recommendations from your friends, colleagues, relatives, or acquaintances</i>. Some of them must have moved house at least once in their lives. Their experiences can tell you a lot about the moving company. Their good or bad stories can help you compare movers and rate them. Certainly, this cannot be the only indicator. We always recommend that you do a bit of research on the mover’s licenses and insurance. </p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/survey-3695464_1920-300x201.jpg"></div>
                <h4>Always check the feedback and reviews of other customers. They are an invaluable source of information.</h4>
                <p>Besides, there are <b>websites and groups on social networks</b> where you can read the feedback of other people. Go through those reviews carefully as some of them might have been written for advertising purposes. Again, we shall remind you to do a data check on the company’s track record. </p>

                </section>
                <p>Compare movers based on customer service</p>
                <p><i>Contact the moving company that seems to suit you</i>. Check if they answer the phone, emails, or messages sent through contact pages. And also note how promptly and fast they reply. A reputable mover has more than one way of contacting. </p>
                <p>Ask them the right questions. Prepare a set of inquiries that will focus on your needs. According to their answers, you can compare movers to find out whose services satisfy you most. <b>Don’t be afraid of asking more sensitive questions</b> regarding licenses, insurance, etc. If they avoid responding to such questions, then something is definitely wrong.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/questions-2132217_1920-300x218.jpg"></div>
                <h4>Ask as many questions as you need. Insist on getting the answers. Be persistent and inquisitive.</h4>
                <p>Check the address as well. You can demand a visit to their offices. Not showing and not revealing the address means you shouldn’t bother hiring them. </p>

                <p>Hidden red flags when evaluating movers</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>When the agents pay a visit to you in order to make an assessment, pay attention to their behavior.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unsure agents don’t have so much experience.</li>
                    <li>Arriving late might be a sign of unprofessional business.</li>
                    <li>Avoiding answers means they may be hiding something.</li>
                    <li>Other types of strange behavior aren’t trustworthy so evaluate moving companies that seem more reliable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Watch out for hidden costs. Usually, <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/tips-for-dealing-with-fraudulent-moving-companies/"> fraudulent moving companies</a> ask for huge deposits prior to relocation or extra charges.</p>
                <p>When evaluating movers, <i>check if they have more than one payment method</i>. Should they receive only cash payments, that’s not fair. It might be an indicator that their finances aren’t sound.</p>
                <p>Final verdict about evaluating moving companies</p>
                <p>After you do research and contact movers, you should compare them. Then evaluate moving companies using marks. Focus on the top three. <b>Making a final decision is really individual</b>. It depends on what you’re looking for. Now do your homework and don’t mind being inquisitive. Good luck!</p>
